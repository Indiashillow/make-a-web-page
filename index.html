  <title>India's Notes</title>
<h1>Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web & HTML</h1>
<b>How the Web Works</b>
<p>The world wide web is a collection of <b>Html</b> documents accessed via the internet. 
<br>When a person accesses a web <b> browser</b> such as internet explorer or firefox to 
<br>access a webpage i.e <a href="www.yahoo.com">yahoo.com</a>, their computer 
sends a <em>HTTP</em> request to a <b>server</b>. 
<br>The server then delivers the web page to the web 
web browser via the Internet. <br>This HTML document is then displayed on the user's
computer.
</p>
<b>Browser</b>
<p>A browser is known as a computer program used to find a view information
<br>on the Internet</br>
</p>
<b>HTTP</b>
<p>"Hypertext Transfer Protocol" better known as <b>HTTP</b>, is the main protocol of the 
<br>web.  The <em>browser</em> uses Http to communicate with the servers.
</p>
<b>Server</b>
<p>A Server is like a little apartment housing all the webpages.  The server 
<br>interprets the Html tags and sends them back as a webpage to our browser.
</p>
<b>HTML</b>
<p>"Hyper Text Markup Language" better known as HTML, is the basis for almost 
<br>every webpage
</p>
<b>Tags & Elements</b>
<p><b>Tags</b> are always contained within an angled bracket. An <b>element</b> is 
<br> everything within a set of opening and closing tags. Html elements are either
<br> inline or block.  Block just means there is an invisible box around the content.
<br>The invisible block can be a certain height and width
</p>
<b>Attributes</b>
<p>Attributes are anchors used for referencing hyper links</p>
<h1>Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document w/ HTML</h1>
<b>Two Languages</b>
<p>HTML and CSS are both "languages".
  Html controls the "structure" of the webpage.  <br>CSS controls the "style" of a webpage.  Html is written in a wave of indentation on the <br>left side of the document</p>
<h4>DOM</h4>
<p> (Document Object Model) they are talking about the tree-like structure of a page.
<h1>Lesson 3: CSS</h1>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets - style sheet language used for describing the look and<br> formatting of a document written in a markup language.</p>
  <b> Repetition</b>
<p>Repetition is one of the main things you have to look out for.  People have a <br> tendency to make mistakes and not be consistant.
